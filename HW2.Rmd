# **1**
Given {b1} = 0.5, the power of the test with 48 degrees of freedom, for a true slope of 1.7, and a null of 0 would be 0.84 then there would be a 84% change of rejecting the null given that the true Î²1 was 1.7.

# **2**

## A

Found by hand the 90% CI for a stoping distance given a starting speed of 15mph is...

## B

```{r}

read.csv("Stop.csv", header = TRUE) -> data

n <-length(data) 
X <-data$speed
Y <-data$dist

reg.stop <-lm(Y ~ X)

new.dat <-data.frame(X=15)
predict(reg.stop, newdata=new.dat, interval="confidence", level=0.90)
ci <- predict(reg.stop, newdata=new.dat, interval="confidence", level=0.90) 
```
## C

We can be 90% confident that the mean stopping distance, in ft, at 15mph is somewhere between (`r ci[2]`), (`r ci[3]`)

# **3** 

## A
90% prediction interval for the stopping distance of a new driver whose speed is 15 mph.

## B

```{r}
predict(reg.stop, newdata=new.dat, interval="predict", level=0.90)
ci <- predict(reg.stop, newdata=new.dat, interval="predict", level=0.90)
```
## C

We can be 90% confident in predicting that a new stopping test conducted at 15mph would produce a stopping distance, in ft, somewhere between (`r ci[2]`), (`r ci[3]`)

# **4** 

## A

A 90% prediction interval for the mean stopping distance of three new drivers each of whose speed is 15 mph.

![Drawing.](/Users/pjs2567/Desktop/HW2-20201009T150925Z-001/HW2/HW2_4.JPG)

## B

```{r include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ALSM)
```
```{r}
ci.reg(reg.stop, new.dat, type = 'nm', alpha=0.10,m=3) -> threeRep

threeRep[3:4]

```

## C

The interval for the total stopping distance for all three tests would be between `r 3*threeRep[3]` and `r 3*threeRep[4]`

# **5**

A 95% confidence band for the simple linear regression line predicting stopping distance using speed.

  geom_point(color='#2980B9', size = 4) +
